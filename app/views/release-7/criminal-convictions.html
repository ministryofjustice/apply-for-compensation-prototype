                    A conviction is spent when a period of time, known as the rehabilitation period, expires.  The length of this period depends on the type and length of your sentence.

      <p class="design-notes">Changed this back and added guidance re unspent.  We couldnt ask the applicant if they have any previous convictions as Rehab of Offenders act doesnt allow us to do so.  Users with spent convictions have no obligation to declare convictions - JK</p>
      <p class="design-notes">providing a comprehensive table/list of rehab periods for different sentences/jurisdictions is difficult.  A calculator would be a good tool to consider future iterations.</p>
      <p class="design-notes">moved hint text to a hidden toggle text 17/7/18 - JK</p>
      <p class="design-notes">data shows only 44 cases were rejected under para 27 in 2017/18 (approx 0.1% of decisions).  What value is added to business by asking users what is a difficult concept to understand and explain?</p>
      <p class="design-notes">18/7/18 changed this to ask if user has convictions, and provided hint text to let those user with spent convictions they arent obliged to tell us</p>
