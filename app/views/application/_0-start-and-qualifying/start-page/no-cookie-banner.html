<p class="govuk-body">If the crime happened between 1 August 1964 and 30 September 1979 and you lived with the attacker as a family member at the time of the incident, you can also <a href="/claim-compensation-criminal-injury/victim-lived-with-attacker-before-october-1979">request someone to call you</a> to start your claim.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">When you make a claim to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA), you may need to provide:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

 <li>the name of the police station where the crime was reported</li>
 <li>your crime reference number</li>

<p class="govuk-body">You’ll be asked if you’ve tried to get compensation or other money you’re entitled to, for example:</p>

<li>by claiming benefits</li>
<li>through insurance payments</li>
<li>from a civil court claim</li>
<li>from a criminal court case (if the crime went to court)</li>
