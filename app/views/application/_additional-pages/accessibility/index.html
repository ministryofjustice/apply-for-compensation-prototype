  <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
  <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
  <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
  <li>listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
