          Information about appointing a legal or other representative
        </h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">You do not need to appoint a legal or other representative to act on this claim. If one is appointed at any stage, please be aware that CICA cannot meet any costs which may be incurred. We will communicate directly with any appointed representative and if we make an award, we will usually only pay it to an applicant or their legal representative. Other arrangements will be made where an application has been made on behalf of an adult who lacks capacity, a child who is under 18 years of age or where the award is being placed in a Trust. Generally, we will place an award for a child in an interest earning deposit account until they reach the age of 18.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">If it is decided that a representative’s services are no longer required, you must tell us in writing as soon as possible. If a monetary award is to be made and there is a dispute about outstanding legal fees, we will usually retain the disputed amount until the dispute has been resolved.</p>
