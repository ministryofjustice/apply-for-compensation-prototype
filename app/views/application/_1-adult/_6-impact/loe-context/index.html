      The impact the injuries have had

    <p class="govuk-body">Weâ€™re going to ask you questions about:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>how your daily life has been impacted by your injuries</li>
      <li>how long the effects of your injuries are likely to last</li>
      <li>your ability to work now and in future</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">The answers you give help build an understanding of how your injuries have affected you.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">In sending this application, you will be considered for compensation for loss of earnings and special expenses.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Loss of earnings</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">If the medical evidence shows the injuries result in very limited or no capacity to work, you may get a loss of earnings payment.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Special expenses</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you cannot work for more than 28 weeks or are likely to lose earnings because of how severe the injuries are, or are incapacitated to a similar extent, you may receive a special expenses payment.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Both of these payment types are to compensate for any financial losses you have because of your injuries.</p>
