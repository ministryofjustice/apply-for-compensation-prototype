      The impact the crime has had — daily life and financially
    </h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">We’re going to ask you questions about:</p>

      <li>how your daily life has been impacted by the crime</li>
      <li>if their injuries are long-term</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">The answers you give help build an understanding of how the crime has affected you.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">In sending this application, you will be considered for compensation for loss of earnings and special expenses.</p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Loss of earnings</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">If the medical evidence shows the injuries result in limited or no capacity to work, you may get a loss of earnings payment.</p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Special expenses</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">If you cannot work for more than six months or are likely to lose earnings because of how severe the injuries are, you may get a special expenses payment.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Both of these payment types are to compensate for any financial losses you have because of the crime.</p>
