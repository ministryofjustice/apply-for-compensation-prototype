    <p class="govuk-body">In sending this application, the child will be considered for compensation for loss of earnings and special expenses.</p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Loss of earnings</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">If the medical evidence shows the injuries result in limited or no capacity to work, they may get a loss of earnings payment.</p>
    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Special expenses</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">If the child cannot work for more than six months or is likely to lose earnings because of how severe the injuries are, they may get a special expenses payment.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Both of these payment types are to compensate for any financial losses they have because of the crime.</p>
