                <p>You need to prove you have parental responsibility or legal authority for the victim to apply.</p>

                <p>To prove this, you'll need relevant documents your name is on, such as:</p>

                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                  <li>the victim’s full birth certificate
                  adoption documents</li>
                  <li>a parental responsibility agreement</li>
                  <li>a court order showing you have parental responsibility, which means you have legal authority, for the victim</li>
                </ul>

                  <p>We need proof so we know you have the right to apply on the victim’s behalf. We'll tell you how to send this at the end of the application.</p>

                  <p>If you’re still unsure about parental responsibility and what it means, you can find out more <a href="https://www.gov.uk/parental-rights-responsibilities/who-has-parental-responsibility" target="_new">on the UK Government website (opens in new tab)</a>.</p>
