    <p>You can continue the application now if you choose to. Or, you can continue the application at a later date. To do so, you'll need the:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>email address or mobile phone number you provided</li>
      <li>victim's name</li>
      <li>victim's date of birth</li>

      How long do you have to finish the application?

    <p>You have <strong>30 days to finish the application</strong> from now. After this, if you have not submitted it, you'll need to start again.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
      You still need to send us the application
    </h2>

    <p>While you can now return to the application at a later date, you need to ensure you submit this before <strong>{{ 30 | getDate }}</strong>.</p>
    <p>If you do not submit this, we are unable to process your application and youâ€™ll need to do it again.</p>
